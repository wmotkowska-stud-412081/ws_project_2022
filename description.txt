Description of the topic and the web page




Description of the scraper mechanics and the output

Our program scraps links to property offers listed on https://www.olx.pl/nieruchomosci/mieszkania/sprzedaz/warszawa/. 
If the boolean parameter is set to True then only 100 links are taken into account. The links cannot be from otodom site and need to be cleaned.

For each link with offer the program scraps :
- name, 
- price, 
- price for m^2, 
- m^2, 
- how many rooms, 
- which floor the apartment is on, 
- where in the property located.

Name and price are scraped from the header. Other properties are scraped from detail table. 
We were only able to obtain map variable in selenium and this property was vital for data analysis.
However, selenium scraper takes the longest time because of time limitations, which are crucial for page to get its full html.

The output is in a form of a dataset (csv format). The characteristics of property offers can be seen on data analysis image below.
The map variable is a string with 'Warszawa' being the first word and district following it. Price and price m^2 are in PLN. 
URL is the link to the offer. 'Parter' in floor means 0.
