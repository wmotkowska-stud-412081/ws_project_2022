## Web scraping project
#### OLX site: property offers in Warsaw

The links to property offers are conditioned on being from olx site as other team chose otodom site for their project. More specific information are in description.pdf.

#### How to run our scrapers:

##### Karolina Kowalska
Working on Beautiful Soup.
To run the file one needs to write in the terminal:
##### python bs4.py
The final dataset should appear in your folder.

##### Magdalena Pruszy≈Ñska
Working on Scrapy. 
In order to get the information on flats offered, one needs to download both spiders from a scrapy project folder. The next step is going to command prompt, making sure that you are in a folder, where all of the spiders downloaded are and type:
###### scrapy runspider spider_links.py -s USER_AGENT="custom_user" -o links.csv 
that should generate links.csv file in the same folder you and spiders are in.
The last step should be going back to your command prompt and typing:
###### scrapy runspider spider2.py -s USER_AGENT="custom_user" -o final_data.csv
The final dataset should appear in your folder.

##### Weronika Motkowska
Working on selenium.
To run the file one needs to change the gecko_path to path to geckodriver on own computer. 
Then in terminal write 
###### python sel.py
Name 'selenium.py' brings confusion because of double-naming.
The final dataset should appear in 'data' folder.
